📌 Introduction
The rise of chronic and life-threatening diseases like diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson’s, brain tumors, TB, and breast cancer demands innovative diagnostic solutions.
Traditional methods are often expensive, slow, and inaccessible, especially in remote regions.

🚑 Challenges in Healthcare Diagnostics
High Costs: Traditional diagnosis is expensive.

Delayed Diagnosis: Late detection worsens patient outcomes.

Limited Early Detection Tools: Lack of proactive care options.

Accessibility Issues: Remote areas suffer due to poor healthcare infrastructure.

💡 Proposed Solution
Accessible and cost-effective AI-based diagnostic system.

Early detection to improve treatment outcomes.

Reduce dependency on expensive equipment.

Increase accuracy and minimize diagnostic errors.
