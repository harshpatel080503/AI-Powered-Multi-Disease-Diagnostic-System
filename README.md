## üìå Introduction
The rise of chronic and life-threatening diseases like diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson‚Äôs, brain tumors, TB, and breast cancer demands innovative diagnostic solutions.  
Traditional methods are often expensive, slow, and inaccessible, especially in remote regions.

---

## üöë Challenges in Healthcare Diagnostics
- **High Costs:** Traditional diagnosis is expensive.
- **Delayed Diagnosis:** Late detection worsens patient outcomes.
- **Limited Early Detection Tools:** Lack of proactive care options.
- **Accessibility Issues:** Remote areas suffer due to poor healthcare infrastructure.

---

## üí° Proposed Solution
- Accessible and cost-effective AI-based diagnostic system.
- Early detection to improve treatment outcomes.
- Reduce dependency on expensive equipment.
- Increase accuracy and minimize diagnostic errors.
